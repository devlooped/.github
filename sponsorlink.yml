# This is the SponsorLink manifest hosted by a sponsorable account on GitHub
# The manifest provides well-known JWT values that are used by both the 
# hosted service to issue and sign SL JWT on user request, as well as the 
# GH CLI and custom library code to verify the authenticity of a cached token.

# Issuer points to a web app containing a `sponsor` endpoint that emits a SL JWT 
# with sponsorship claims for the GH authenticated user (via a Bearer token)
issuer: https://sponsorlink.devlooped.com/

# Public key to verify JWTs generated by the issuer, for offline verification.
