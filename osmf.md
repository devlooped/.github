## Open Source Maintenance Fee

To ensure the long-term sustainability of this project, use of $product$ requires an 
[Open Source Maintenance Fee](https://opensourcemaintenancefee.org). While the source 
code is freely available under the terms of the [MIT License](license.txt), all other aspects of the 
project --including opening or commenting on issues, participating in discussions and 
downloading releases-- require [adherence to the Maintenance Fee](osmfeula.txt).

In short, if you use this project to generate revenue, the [Maintenance Fee is required](osmfeula.txt).

To pay the Maintenance Fee, [become a Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) at the corresponding 
OSMF tier (starting at just $10!).
